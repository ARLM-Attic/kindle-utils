Kindle Utils
============

Various utilities for doing things with a Kindle.

* log_parser.py: Parse a kindle logfile, or a directory of log files and track
  the use of the kindle. Power states and book statistics are tracked.

* book_stats.py: Print a report on book reading time, based on the statistics
  collected by log_parser.py.

* mobibook.py: Parse and return the Mobi and EXTH metadata in a mobibook file.

* apnx_parser.py: Parse and return the page number/position information in a
  Kindle Page Number Sidecar (.apnx) binary file.

* fetch-logs: Shell script to assist in pulling log files off the Kindle.

How to Use
----------
You need a jailbroken Kindle with SSH access (either via usbnet, or wifi). Once
you've got one of those, use the fetch-logs script to pull logs from your
Kindle into a local directory, and then run kindle-stats.py pointing it at the
directory containing the logs. Voila. Make sure you run fetch-logs regularly
enough that you don't lose any logfiles (once a week seems sufficient) and
you've got all you need to calculate fairly accurate stats about your reading
habits.

For additional points, you can pass some extra options to the python scripts,
see --help for details.  The most interesting option is -b for book_stats.py,
which you should point to a directory containing the actual book files from
your Kindle. By default this points to /media/Kindle/documents, which is where
a Kindle seems to appear on a recent Ubuntu system. When this option is
present, kindle_stats.py will extract the titles and page number information
from the book and sidecar files to use in its output, I find this much more
useful than looking at a list of ASINs and Kindle positions.

e.g.
$ mkdir kindle-logs
$ cd kindle-logs
$ fetch-logs .
$ kindle_stats.py -b /media/Kindle/documents .
